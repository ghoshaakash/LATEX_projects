\section{Introduction}

\section{Include Script}
We will be using TensorFlow for our works here. The \verb|include| script looks like the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Loading Data}
For the examples we mentioned above we can simply use already available datasets:
\begin{lstlisting}
    fashion_mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()
\end{lstlisting}
We split in train-validation-test segments:
\begin{lstlisting}
    (X_train_full, y_train_full), (X_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist
    X_train, y_train = X_train_full[:-5000], y_train_full[:-5000]
    X_valid, y_valid = X_train_full[-5000:], y_train_full[-5000:]
\end{lstlisting}
Now define the class labels:
\begin{lstlisting}
    class_names = ["T-shirt/top", "Trouser", "Pullover", "Dress", "Coat","Sandal", "Shirt", "Sneaker", "Bag", "Ankle boot"]
\end{lstlisting}
And we are ready to go. Things to note:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inputs must be \verb|numpy| arrays.
\end{enumerate}
